<h2>PC Bookings</a></h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The pc booking system has 3 components.
<ul>
<li>An intranet pc booking system accessible by staff</li>
<li>Client software that allows computers to self book on the spot, or log into a booked computer.</li>
<li>A web script to allow patrons to prebook.</li>
</ul>

The client software and web script are optional components.

<h3>Setup overview</h3>
<p>To set the PC bookings module the following steps need to be taken via the 
  content management menu.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Creating branch locations</li>
  <li>Defining location opening hours</li>
  <li>Define booking types</li>
  <li>Adding computers to a location</li>
  <li>Setting public holidays, branch closures or banned patrons.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2 - Defining location opening hours</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the &quot;edit&quot; clock icon beside the location that you want to configure 
  opening hours.</p>

  <br>
  <strong>Charge</strong><br>
  This field indicates if this booking type has a charge. For example some libraries 
  do not charge for internet access but charge for word processing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Booking type only visible to edit users</strong><br>
  This field can be useful. For example you may want a booking type for PC Maintenance. 
  You may only want specific users able to book out a PC for maintenance. If 
  this field was set to YES then the booking form would make this booking type 
  available to power users only. For more information on power users see administrator 
  documentation. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Include booking type in booking statistics</strong><br>
  The booking system gives booking statistics by booking type. You may have some 
  usage types that you may not want included. An example could be PC maintenance. 
</p>
<p><strong>Display print link for booking slips</strong><br>
  The booking page will display a link for printing booking receipts through a 
  transaction printer.. </p>

  underneath each booking on the PC bookings page.
   <br>
  <br>
    
   <strong>Allow web bookings</strong><br>
  If this is enabled, this booking type can be booked through the web bookings page. This is a script external to the intranet that can be used for self bookings over the internet.

		<br><br>
  
    <strong>Delete IE history and cleanup desktop</strong><br>

    <strong>Number of minutes a patron is locked out from rebooking a self booking PC.</strong><br>
  This parameter applies to computers that are self booking. This parameter can stop a user from immediately rebooking a computer when the session finishes.
  This might be used with a "15 minute" computer. You may want a "cooling off" period to allow other users to access the computer.
   <br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>Maximum time that can be self booked in day. 0 means no limit.</strong><br>
  This is a limit on the amount of time patrons can book themselves in a particular day. There is no restriction on bookings via staff.   <br>
  <br>
  
      <strong>Number of minutes until unfulfilled bookings are cancelled on self booking computers.</strong><br>
   This parameter applies to computers that are self booking. Bookings can be cancelled after a designated number of minutes if the booked person does not show up.

<h3>4 - Adding computers to a location</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add computers to a location, click on the computer icon beside 
  the location you want to add to.</p>
<p><br>
  <img src="images/Untitled-92.gif"><br>
  Click on the "add" icon.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/Untitled-93.gif"> <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The &quot;add computer&quot; form will display allowing you to create a computer.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/Untitled-94.gif"></p>
  <p><strong>Name<br>
  </strong>Computer name as it appears on the staff pc bookings page.</p>
  

  
  <p><strong> Display computer on booking sheet<br>
  </strong>If this is set to "no", then the computers will not be displayed on the bookings page by default. However staff can display it by clicking on a "show computers" link. Computers with ethe self booking client software would be set to "No".</p>
   <img src="images/Untitled-105.gif">
  
<p><strong>Allocated booking types<br>
  </strong>This allows you to associate one or more booking types to a computer. 
  At least one booking type must be associated to the computer before it can be 
  booked.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Client authentication<br>
  </strong>
    The self booking computers can be authenticated ( the machine not the user) by ip address or password. 
  <Ul>
  <li>IP address. This requires that there is no NAT firewall between the intranet server and client machines. </li>
  If the client PC is running Apache as part of client installation, you can enable "poll client". The intranet will immediately notify the client PC of booking changes, otherwise client PC will poll every 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Password This requires that the password is configured in the client pc booking software.<br>
  
 

  
  
  </Ul>
  
  

  
  
<p><strong>Display colour<br>
  </strong>Default the bookings page will display using alternating row colours 
  using the intranet colour scheme. You can however have the column for each computer 
  display in a defined colour. This may be of use to prevent staff error, if you 
  have different booking types associated to different computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/Untitled-95.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If one or more computers have been defined, they will be listed visually in 
  the order they will be appear on the bookings page. The  arrows allow 
  you to customize the column order of the bookings page.</p>
<p> <br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3>5 - Setting public holidays, branch closures or banned patrons.</h3>
<p><br>
  <br>
  Public holidays are days that will make all booking locations display as closed. 
  Public holidays are defined by the intranet administrator.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/Untitled-96.gif"></p>
<p>To close a single location for a period of time click on the &quot;Branch closures&quot; 
  link. This may be useful if a single branch was closed for renovations.</p>
<p><img src="images/Untitled-97.gif"><br>
  <br>
  To block a patron from the booking system you may add patron barcodes that are 
  blocked for a defined period of time. To do this click on the &quot;Banned patrons&quot; 
  link. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
