<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>To create a calendar to edit.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The administrator must create a calendar module.</li>
  <li>The administrator must define one or more event types.</li>
  <li>The administrator must allocate one or more event types to the calendar 
    module. </li>

</ol>

To edit a calendar you will need to to choose the calendar module from the module

<h3>Add event</h3>

  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>You will then have a choice of event types that the calendar allows. The number 
  of event types listed is dependant upon the number of event types defined by 
  the administrator. It is also dependant upon which types this calendar can use. 
  This is set by the administrator. <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  After choosing the event type, enter details of the event in the add event form. 
  The number of fields on this form will depend upon how the event type was defined 
  by the administrator. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  To cancel an event, change the status to "cancelled". A cancelled event will display 
  on the calendar as cancelled. Selecting delete will remove the event 
  and any related bookings completely from the calendar.</p>
<p><br>

  <br>
</p>
<h3>Recurrent events</h3>
<p>An event type may be defined as capable of recurrent bookings. (see the &quot;Calendars&quot; 
  page of the administrator manual on how to do this). This allows you to to create 
  multiple events in one go.</p>
<p>To make an event recurrent, select &quot;yes&quot;, choose the recurrence period 
  and number of occurrences.</p>
<p>

Events that are created recurrently may be later edited individually or as a group.

<h3>Create event templates</h3>
<p>If you need to create a number of events that have similar details you can 
  reduce the amount of manual input by using event templates. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/Untitled-26.gif"><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Click on "Edit event templates". A list of any existing templates will appear 
  that can be edited. To create a new event template click on "Add template". 
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/Untitled-27.gif"><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Choose an event type for the template.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/Untitled-28.gif" ><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The next form is the same as creating an event except that the form has a button 
  "add template" instead of "Add event".</p>
<p><br>
  <br>

  <br>
</p>

<h3>Event tags</h3>
<p>You can add tags that will help with keyword searching for events. Tags are not displayed to the end user. A collection of tags may be stored for reuse.</p>

<p>
	<p><img src="images/Untitled-116.gif" ></p>
<h3>Using event templates</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Event templates is a fast way of adding repetitious input. Follow the usual 
  steps for creating an event. When you get to the Add Event form, there will 
  be a list of available event templates for this event type.</p>
<p><br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/Untitled-30.gif"><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  If you click on one of the event templates it will populate the Add Event form 
  with the template details. Change any details as necessary and then click on 
  "Add event". </p>
<p><br>

</p>
<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you calendar has event types that take bookings, you can access booking statistics.</p>
<p><br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/Untitled-32.gif"><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>These consist of monthly totals for each event type.</p>
