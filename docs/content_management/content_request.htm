<h1>Brushtail Content Management Guide</h1>
<h2>Request tracking</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Request tracking modules display to the staff a form for logging requests. 
  Unlike an email form, these requests are stored in the database.</p>
<p>Editing a request tracking module through content management allows you to 
  edit the form interface that staff submit requests through. </p>
<p>This form interface is visible to users with read permissions when the module 
  is accessed through the main navigation menu. When users with power user or 
  edit permissions access this module through the main navigation menu they do 
  not see this form, what they see instead is an archive of requests that can 
  be searched, edited, printed or deleted.</p>
<p>To edit the request form, click on the request form module in the content management 
  menu.</p>

<ol>
<li>Submit form only</li>	
<li>Search form only (with read only search results)</li>	
<li>Submit form and search form</li>		
</ol>
The view is selected via "helpdesk options" in content management.

<p><img src="images/Untitled-114.gif"></p>
<h3>Email address</h3>
<p>The email address specified here will appear in the "from" field of any messages sent from the helpdesk. If this field is blank, then the email address specified in the user account settings of the Helpdesk user will be used.
If the helpdesk user has no email address specified in their user account, then the $EMAIL_FROM parameter specified in config.php will be used.</P>




<h3>Email notification</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>No email messages</b> - Email disabled.</li>	
<li><b>Allow email messages</b> - Email messaging enabled.</li>	
<li><b>Automatic messages</b>- Email messaging enabled. Also an automated email is sent, when a requests is added. Emails are sent to the email address specified in the Helpdesk options. </li>		
</ol>	
	
	
	
</p>

<h3>Display delete button to power users </h3>
<p>
Power users can view, search, add, edit and delete requests. You may want to restrict the ability to delete. This option can hide the delete button.
</p>

<h3>Show 'reuse form data' button </h3>

<p>
	When a user with "read" privileges submits a request, the form submission is followed by a confirmation message with a link back to a blank request form.
	There is an optional additional link labelled "reuse form data". This links back to the form populated with data from the previous request. This feature is used on forms where there will be multiple similar requests.
</p>

 
<h3>Display job timer</h3>
<p>
If this feature is enabled, users with power or edit privileges can time how long is spent answering requests. When editing a request there is "Start timer" button. The "Stop timer" button will stop the timer and store the timed duration. The timer can be stopped and started repeatedly. 	
</p>


<h3>Text to links</h3>
<p>
If this feature is enabled any URLs will be converted to hyperlinks.
</p>


<h3>Assignment</h3>
<p>
If this feature is enabled, requests can be assigned to team members, who will receive a notification email. 	
</p>





<h3>Request tracking module - power or edit view</h3>
<p>A power user is able to view, search, add, edit and delete from the request. An edit user can modify the submit form via content management.</p>
