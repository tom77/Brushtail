<h2>Leave applications</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This module allows staff to apply for leave via the intranet. The manager is alerted by email of any leave  applications. 
Staff can edit and update leave applications until they have been approved. Once approved, leave applications can only be edited by managers.
The manager can see a summary of pending applications. 
When applications are approved, an email is sent back to the applicant, informing them of application status. Staff groups can be created to allow granular control over manager permissions.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create leave module via Intranet administration > Main menu</li>
<li>Grant edit permissions to content manager</li>
<li>Edit Leave module via content management. Create leave types (sick leave, annual leave etc). Create at least on staff group.
The group will need members, a manager and an email alertee (usually the manager). Note that participating staff will need to have the firstname, lastname and email address fields completed in their user accounts. 
This information is input by the intranet administrator</li>

<li>Staff that are in a leave group will be able to apply for leave, and view a chronological list or a calendar view of their leave applications.</li>
<li>Staff that are "managers" in a leave group will be able to apply for leave, and view a list or calendar view of their applications.
