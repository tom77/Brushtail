<h2>Wiki pages</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
A wiki module is similar to a content module except for the following features.
<ul>
<li>Pages are created by using Wikinames</li>	
<li>Navigation structure is more free form</li>

</ul>	
	
	
</p>
<h3>Permissions</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Read - read only</li>
<li>Power user - Allowed to post comments to pages.</li>
<li>Edit - Full edit privileges via main menu</li>
	
	
</ul>
	
</p>

<h3>Wikinames</h3>
<p>Wikinames are two or more capitalized words joined together without spaces. For example "NewPage". 
If a wikiname is used in page content it will appear as a link to another wiki page. 
If the wiki page does not exist, a user with edit privileges who is viewing the page in "edit mode" will be able to create a new page simply by clicking on the link.
 </p>
 <h3>Navigation structure is more free form</h3>
 
	<p>
		
		A content module has a fixed menu hierarchy, with a page of contents automatically created. 
		A wiki module has no limit to the levels of navigation. Navigation menus are created by the user. 
		"page list" links to an alphabetical listing of all pages in wiki module.
		"Recent changes" lists pages that have changed.
		
	</p>
<h3>Normal view /Edit view</h3>
 
	<p>
		
		A user with edit permissions has the option of an "edit mode" when viewing pages. 
		Edit mode allows adding pages, editing content, uploading images and documents, and restoring changes.
