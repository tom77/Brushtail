<h1>PC self bookings client manual: php-gtk2 version</h1>
	
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	The booking client is a program that allows patrons to self checkin/book computers. 
	The booking system can be used the following modes:
	<ul>
	 <li><b>Barcode mode</b><br> Patrons are authenticated via their library barcode. Brushtail will check credentials against the web catalogue.
	 Patrons sit down at an available computer and self book. Alternatively they may be prebooked via the intranet or via the Web</li>
	 <li>
	 <b>PIN mode</b> <br>Bookings are authenticated via single use PINs. No external authentication. Bookings are made by library staff
	</li></ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>The original version was written in Visual Basic. This has been superceeded by a version written in PHP-GTK2</p>
	<h2>Installation Requirements</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Client PCs running Windows XP/Windows 7</li>
	<li>Brushtail intranet server</li>
	<li>Client PC has security software that denies access to Ctrl + Alt + Delete</li>
	
	
	</ul>
	<h2>Installation instructions</h2>
	<h3>Configure Brushtail</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>If authenticating via patron barcodes, edit config.php and set $PCAUTHENTICATION to "web". This step not necessary if using "PIN" mode</li>
	<li>Create a PC booking type through Content Management > PC Bookings > Booking type. (Note the "Client software parameters")</li>
	<li>Create a PC bookings location through Content Management > PC Bookings > Locations</li>
	<li>Create a PC bookings computers for the location through Content Management > PC Bookings > Location > Add computer.<br>
	If using IP authentication, setting the "poll client" will make client computers respond immediately to booking changes made via intranet.
	</li>

	<li>The PC may be authenticated by static IP address or shared password. 
	The Computer details in the intranet content management must have either an ip address or a password.
	If no password is set, ip authentication will be attempted. An ip address is necessary for polling. If using a password, this must match the password inthe ini.xml on the client computer.
