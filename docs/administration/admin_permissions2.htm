<h3>Power users</h3>
<p><br>
  <br>
  Power user status gives a user additional capabilities in certain parts of the 
  intranet. </p>
<p><br>
  <br>
  <b>Calendars</b><br>
  A power user is able to add, edit and delete event bookings if the calendar 
  allows bookings. Read permissions only allow the ability to read bookings.</p>
<p><b>Content module</b><br>
  A power user is able to post, edit and delete to a noticeboard page. Read permissions 
  only allow the ability to read the noticeboard. Power users can also post comments on content pages.</p>
<p><b>Docbox</b><br>
  A power user is able to add, edit and delete documents from document archive. 
  Read permissions only allow the ability to browse and search documents.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Inventory</b><br>
  A power user is able to add, edit and delete items from the inventory. Read 
  permissions only allow the ability to browse and search the inventory.<br>
  <br>
  <b>PC Bookings</b><br>
  Read - User may only view pc bookings sheet.<br>
  Power user - User may add and edit to pc bookings sheet.<br>
  Edit - May add computers, booking types, change branch hours. Some booking types may be only available to power users.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Request tracking</b><br>
  A power user is able to view, search, add, edit and delete from the request 
  archive. Read permissions will only give the user a form for submitting requests and or searching requests. This is edited through content management under "helpdesk options".<br>
  <br>
  <b>Rooms & Equipment Bookings</b><br>
   A power user is able to add, edit and delete bookings. Read permissions give only the ability to view bookings.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Staff calendar</b><br>
  A power user is able to edit staff availability for any given day. Read permissions 
  only allow the ability to read the calendar. Edit permissions are needed to 
  edit the weekly templates.</p>
   <b>Wiki</b><br>
  Power users can post comments on wiki pages.</p>

<h3>IP Access</h3><br><br>
 	For any user or group you can restrict access to an intranet module by IP address or network address. If a network address is specified, users can only access from that network address.  If user has 
		multiple ip restrictions to a module, due to group memberships, then any of those restrictions if not met will block access. Network addresses should be entered without the trailing zeros. 
<br><br>Examples:
<br>192.168.2.0 should be entered as 192.168.2
<br>10.10.0.0 should be entered as 10.10 
		<br><br>
		This feature is for managing intranet users. For more information about security see the "Security" page of this manual.
 <h3>How permissions work</h3>
<p><br>
  <br>
  A user will only see listed in the main navigation menu items (modules) for 
  which that user has at least read permissions to view. This includes the administrator, 
  who must give her/himself permissions to see the full main menu. When a user 
  does a keyword search on the intranet, it will only search modules that the 
  user has permissions to view. Permissions may be granted on an individual basis. 
  They can also be granted via a group. A user may be a member of multiple groups. 
</p>
<p>Permissions are additive, the permissions for a user is the sum total of individual 
  and group permissions. Higher permissions will override lower permissions. For 
  example, if a user has no permissions for a module at the user level but has 
  read permissions via membership of a group, then that user will have read permission.<br>
